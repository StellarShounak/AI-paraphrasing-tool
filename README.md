# AI-paraphrasing-tool

Paraphrasing tool: For creating a paraphrasing AI tool, I have utilized the PEGASUS model from Google Research, which is a state-of-the-art pre-trained model designed specifically for text paraphrasing tasks. To implement the PEGASUS model and facilitate its usage, I have leveraged the transformers library from Hugging Face, a popular NLP library that provides easy-to-use interfaces for working with various pre-trained models, including PEGASUS.
